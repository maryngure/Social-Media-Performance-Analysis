# Social-Media-Performance-Analysis

##  Project Title and Description

**Social Media Analytics Dashboard**  
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that explores the performance of social media content across multiple platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.). The goal is to provide clear insights into audience engagement, post timing, content effectiveness, and geographic trends to inform marketing strategy and content planning.

The dashboard was created as part of a data storytelling challenge and is designed to answer key business questions such as:
- Which platforms and post types generate the highest engagement?
- What content performs best across regions?
- What are the best times to post?
- Which hashtags are most effective in driving impressions and clicks?
